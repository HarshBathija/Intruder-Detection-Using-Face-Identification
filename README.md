# Intruder-Detection-Using-Face-Identification

This system includes a camera, which captures live images and detects any intrusion in the room in which it is installed. This camera is connected to a system, which already stores the facial features of the Admin and its family members or office employees. The face of the intruder is extracted from the captured images and video. If this face matches the existing faces in the database then no action takes place; however, if the face does not match, an alarm rings and an SMS is sent to the Admin indicating intrusion. The dataset.zip file has the stored dataset which was used to train the system.
